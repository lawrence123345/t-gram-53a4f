# Login Design Improvement Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Add Font Awesome CDN**: Edit index.html to include the Font Awesome link in the <head> section for icon support.

2. **Update HTML in auth.js**: Modify window.renderLogin() and window.showSignup() functions to include Font Awesome icons (e.g., fa-envelope for email, fa-lock for password) within input groups for better visual appeal.

3. **Enhance CSS Styles**: Edit public/css/style.css to add/improve styles for .login-container, .login-card, input groups with icons, buttons with gradients/animations, links, and ensure responsiveness/dark mode compatibility.

4. **Verify Changes**: Use browser_action to launch the page, test login render, input focus/hover effects, signup toggle, and confirm no errors in console/screenshot.

5. **Complete Task**: Once tested successfully, mark as done and use attempt_completion.

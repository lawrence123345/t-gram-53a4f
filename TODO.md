# TODO: Implement Achievements Feature in Game Profile

## 1. Update Profile UI (public/js/profile.js)
- Add "Achievements" button below the avatar in the profile UI.
- Create Achievements section UI to display all six badges with:
  - Badge images for each rarity level.
  - Progress bars showing user progress.
  - Unlock status and glow/animation for unlocked badges.
- Implement badge selection to show detailed info and progress.
- Add animations and visual highlights for user interactions.
- Update profile to show unlocked badge image.

## 2. Badge Data and Logic
- Define badge data structure with:
  - Name, image path, unlock condition, progress requirement.
- Track player progress and unlock badges based on milestones:
  - Common: Play 1 game.
  - Uncommon: Win 5 games.
  - Rare: Score 100 points.
  - Epic: Win 20 games.
  - Legendary: Score 500 points.
  - Mythical: Unlock all previous badges.
- Provide instant visual feedback on badge unlock.

## 3. CSS Styling (public/css/style.css)
- Add styles for badges, progress bars, glow effects, animations.
- Ensure polished and visually enhanced design consistent with existing styles.

## 4. Integration with Game Logic (public/js/game.js or app.js)
- Connect badge unlocking logic with game milestones.
- Update badge progress and unlock status immediately on milestone completion.

## 5. Testing and Validation
- Verify Achievements button appears and navigates correctly.
- Confirm badges display correctly with images and progress.
- Test badge unlocking and visual feedback.
- Ensure profile updates with unlocked badge image.

I will start with step 1: updating profile.js to add the Achievements button and Achievements section UI.
